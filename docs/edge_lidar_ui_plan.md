# LiDAR Road Scan Visualization UI

This document outlines a proposed interface for emergency responders to view LiDAR road scans and Gemma-generated summaries. The interface is optimized for local edge hardware such as the Jetson Nano.

## 1. Main Dashboard

- **Interactive 3D Map** showing LiDAR data in real time
  - Panning, zooming and rotation controls
  - Color-coded hazard levels:
    - **Red** – blocked or hazardous areas
    - **Amber** – partially obstructed
    - **Green** – clear routes
- **Gemma Summaries** panel with automatically generated text describing current hazards
  - Time-stamped entries for chronological review
  - Critical alerts highlighted

## 2. Alerts and Notifications

- Visual and audible alerts for severe conditions
- Sorted by severity so the most critical appear first
- One-click dismissal to keep the interface uncluttered

## 3. Emergency Route Management

- Quick-access buttons for common emergency routes
- Automatic re-routing suggestions driven by the Gemma analysis

## 4. Edge Performance Optimization

- Designed to run on-device to ensure low latency
- Supports offline operation when network connectivity is down

## 5. Visibility and Accessibility

- Dark-mode color scheme for low-light conditions
- Large, easy-to-tap controls for gloved hands
- Optionally, voice playback of summaries for hands-free use

## 6. Technology Overview

- **Lovable Framework** components such as Cards, Charts and Modals for UI layout
- **Gemma** language model hosted locally on the Jetson Nano or similar hardware
- Real-time LiDAR data streamed from the connected sensor stack

## 7. Example Layout

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| [Logo]             LiDAR Road Scan Dashboard          |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| [Interactive LiDAR Map]                 [Alerts Panel]|
| (Color-coded, interactive)              [Gemma hazard |
|                                         summaries]    |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| [Emergency Route Buttons] [Immediate Re-route Option] |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| [Edge Connectivity Indicator] | [System Status Icons] |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

## 8. Usability Testing

Scenario-based exercises with responders will help refine the layout and response time requirements. Feedback loops should drive iterative improvements.
